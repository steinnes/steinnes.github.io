                    <section>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve written about <a href="/post/reinventing-the-wheel">StatsD</a> <a href="/post/datadog">before</a>,
but it&rsquo;s time to pick up the pen again, at least in the proverbial sense (I&rsquo;m
typing this on a laptop-chiclet keyboard).</p>

<p>A few months ago I joined a new company: <a href="http://takumi.com">Takumi</a>
and we&rsquo;re building an iOS app married to a Python Flask-based backend. From
many perspectives, a very similar tech stack as we used at QuizUp.  And it&rsquo;s no
coincidence.  One of the founders of Takumi is <a href="http://twitter.com/jokull">Jökull Sólberg</a>,
who I worked closely with at QuizUp and as far as I know had a major effect on
the initial technology stack used there.</p>

<p>Having used this technology to build a product which got a million active users
in little over a week, I think it&rsquo;s a fair assumption that we are comfortable
with the problems and solutions presented on the backend by this choice of tech.
But it&rsquo;s always possible to tweak, and that&rsquo;s what this blog post is about.</p>

<p>At QuizUp, one of the lessons I learned, and I&rsquo;ve openly <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/steinnes/quizup-zero-to-a-million-users-in-8-days?slide=16">spoken of</a>
is the importance of metrics and instrumenting code, specifically using StatsD
and <a href="http://www.datadog.com">Datadog</a> is my preferred service for
making those metrics visible and reacting to them.  We generally did this
using a combination of two techniques:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A fairly ingenious view decorator which took the metric name as a parameter,
wrapped a Flask view and and emitted a statsd timing for the view.  Instant
visibility into your view latencies!  I credit <a href="https://twitter.com/johannth">Jói</a>,
the CTO of QuizUp for this.  He&rsquo;s an amazing developer and generally one of the
nicest human beings you&rsquo;ll ever meet.</p></li>

<li><p>For those views which did a lot of things, we wrote a little context manager
which could do the same as the view decorator, but for any code block.  This
piece of code was born as our &ldquo;home&rdquo; endpoint (a big-fat-gimme-everything for
the client home screen) started becoming slower and slower.  We needed some
way of monitoring which parts of the response were taking the longest to retrieve
or generate.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I mentioned before, now I&rsquo;m with another company and doing similar things, and
as I&rsquo;m wont to do, I try and improve/iterate on what I&rsquo;m doing.  At Takumi I
started implementing a similar view decorator, meaning some potentially repetitive
code like this everywhere:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/507d894df8f445172c8b.js"></script>
</p>

<p>Basically adding a <code>view_metric</code> decorator around every view with a metric
name which should be easily derivable from the view name or request path.  First
I thought &ldquo;Ah, the metric name should be derived from the request endpoint name!&rdquo;,
but replacing <code>@view_metric(&quot;...&quot;)</code> with <code>@view_metric</code> for over a hundred
different views still is quite repetitive.</p>

<p>Thinking back I remembered having used Werkzeug&rsquo;s <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/contrib/profiler/">ProfilingMiddleware</a>
back when performance tuning QuizUp, so I thought I&rsquo;d explore writing my own
StatsD MiddleWare for Flask.:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/32aad08050f642245dd1.js"></script>
</p>

<p><s>There&rsquo;s one pretty big assumption here, which is that the all dynamic parts of
a URL are UUIDs.  Look at <code>def _metric_name_from_path</code> for details, but there
I basically use a regular expression to replace any UUID&rsquo;s in the URL string
with <code>id</code>.  Probably a more robust approach would be to parse the request path
and construct it out of safe characters found between slashes.  I&rsquo;ll see if
there&rsquo;s a smarter way if I make a proper flask plugin out of this.</s>
Update: I rewrote the metric name construction to use the Flask app&rsquo;s URL map.
See <a href="/post/flask-statsd-revisited/">this post</a> for details :-)</p>

<p>The code above includes a couple of little extras:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>StatsD</code>: a statsd wrapper I wrote to automatically add certain tags to all
metrics emitted.  That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve done before, and not really related to
Flask or Werkzeug, but we are using this at Takumi so I decided to include it.</li>
<li><code>get_cpu_time</code>: the middleware and the context manager both always retrieve
the actual cpu time and submit that as a separate metric.  This is a neat
little trick I suppose most devops people will be used to, and can be very
helpful to detect both wasted cpu cycles and external bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a minimal example of how to use the middleware:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/ebe4b170a46b3b74d7da.js"></script>
</p>

<p>To time specific blocks of your code you can import <code>TimingStats</code> and use it
directly:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2cd21b3fa2877cdf8ac4.js"></script>
</p>

<p>We launched Takumi on the 11th of November and we&rsquo;re using this code in
production, and although I have a nagging suspicion I&rsquo;ll discover some unpaid
price for this magic, we are seeing metrics for all of our views completely
automatically :-)</p>

<p>For convenience sake if anyone wants to use this stuff, here&rsquo;s a github repo:
