<h2 id="background:b772dd71da68016dc4c081d97a69b162">Background</h2>

<p>This summer Apple announced that they would require all apps submitted to the
App Store to support IPv6.  At Takumi we were not concerned, as in the
past I had noticed Amazon ELB&rsquo;s have both AAAA records and a nice
&ldquo;dualstack&rdquo; DNS name which had both A records and AAAA records for the
underlying hosts &ndash; and the Takumi API is accessed through an AWS ELB.</p>

<p>Then about a month ago we got our first app rejection because our API was not
reachable in an IPv6-only network Apple have setup for testing.  To my surprise
and despair there were no AAAA records, or a &ldquo;dualstack&rdquo; DNS name on any
of our ELBs.  Also I was surprised because our DNS setup did not include any
AAAA records, so it seems Apple was testing this without using a DNS64/NAT64
network.</p>

<p>Quickly I found out that the reason for this is that the Virtual Private Cloud
offering of AWS does not support IPv6 (some support has been rolled out now
in select regions), and I surmise that any resources created to wrap publicly
accessible VPC instances are thus IPv4-only as well.  All of our ELB&rsquo;s and ALB&rsquo;s
have only A records, and no AAAA records associated with their DNS names.</p>

<p>To sum up: because we are a new customer of AWS, we are forced to use the VPC
offering, which replaces EC2-Classic (as it&rsquo;s now known), and this newer
compute cloud does not support IPv6, which there is growing pressure around
the internet to fully support.  I was not pleased.</p>

<h2 id="first-solution:b772dd71da68016dc4c081d97a69b162">First solution</h2>

<p>My first solution was to find a cloud provider which would give me a publicly
accessible (IPv4 and IPv6) machine, and Digital Ocean became the provider of
choice.  I setup a debian machine there, an nginx proxy listening on the IPv6
interface and proxying to IPv4 backends using our ELB CNAME.</p>

<h2 id="caveats:b772dd71da68016dc4c081d97a69b162">Caveats</h2>

<p>While a quick and easy solution for most engineers to implement, this solution
is both complex as it requires more moving parts and introduces a single point
of failure in another datacenter with another provider &ndash; although the proxy is
only used for IPv6.  More alarmingly though, because it is not possible to create
multiple DNS records with the same name with both CNAME and A/AAAA record types,
I had to hardcode the ELB IP addresses as A-records on api.takumi.com, while the
AAAA record pointed to the IPv6 address of the proxy.</p>

<p>This meant that if AWS changes the IP addresses of our ELB, which they might do
at any moment and actively discourage any reliance on them, instead providing their
own DNS names which should be accessed via CNAME entries from customer hostnames;
our users would be stuck accessing outdated IP addresses which might not even
answer, and certainly wouldn&rsquo;t route traffic to our actual cloud servers.</p>

<p>A real solution would be to get a single DNS hostname from Amazon which would
contain both IPv6 and IPv4 (AAAA and A records) which will reliably reach our
load balancers, without the need to monitor for IP address changes, or add new
proxy machines to our operational environment!</p>

<h2 id="cloudfront-to-the-rescue:b772dd71da68016dc4c081d97a69b162">CloudFront to the Rescue</h2>

<p>After consulting with a friend who&rsquo;s an engineer with Amazon the simplest
solution (with the added benefit of giving us lower latencies and DDoS
protection) would be to setup a non-caching CloudFront distribution, the origin
of which would be our production Elastic Load Balancer.  When creating a
CloudFront distribution it is possible to enable IPv6, and by allowing all HTTP
methods, and choosing to forward <code>All</code> HTTP hedars, and to forward all cookies
and query string parameters, you&rsquo;ve created a non-caching IPv6 accessible
CloudFront distribution.</p>

<h2 id="migrating:b772dd71da68016dc4c081d97a69b162">Migrating</h2>

<p>Since the new setup means having a CDN in front of our API, which essentially
means deploying a distributed caching system in front of an API which almost
by definition can be dangerous to cache accidentally, and we also rely on our
own custom HTTP headers for identifying different client platforms and versions.</p>

<p>In short: I don&rsquo;t want to switch all of our traffic onto CloudFront in one go
as some insidious bugs might surface, and due to the aggressive caching and
TTL ignoring of many large ISPs and DNS providers, the fallout could be rather
painful.</p>

<p>To migrate gradually to our new CloudFront distribution I then decided to change
our main API DNS entry to a set of weighted records, starting with 99% of lookups
receiving my workaround solution, and 1% the new CloudFront distribution.</p>

<p>

        <img src="http://static.steinn.org/blog/post/aws-cf-ipv6-2.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Migrating to the new setup</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>In a few days, if we have no issues with the new setup we can change the weights
on those records to gradually move more traffic over to CloudFront, or all at once.</p>

<p>The final setup will then be like this, and on top of getting the IPv6 support we
need to avoid any random rejections at Apple, we&rsquo;ll also benefit from better
latencies and we are in a stronger position to deal with any DDoS attacks as well.</p>
