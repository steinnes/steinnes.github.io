        A couple of months ago I wrote about automatically emitting statsd metrics for Flask views using a Werkzeug middleware. There was one rather large caveat though: how I dealt with dynamic URL parameters. Optimally I would have matched the incoming request against the available URL rules or routes in Flask, and used the URL rule metadata to generate a stable metric name. To save time I relied upon the fact that all dynamic URL parts in our API were at the time UUID&rsquo;s.

        If you&rsquo;re using small t2 instances on Elastic Beanstalk which only have 1GB or less of memory, you may run out of memory while doing rare, yet memory intensive tasks such as deploying (and/or building) your app. If your app does not require a lot of memory except during those rare moments, increasing your instance size and being overprovisioned 99% of the time is not a solution which should satisfy a good engineer.

        At Takumi we use Elastic Beanstalk, which is a nice API/service from AWS which strikes a decent balance between a heroku-esque simplified service interface for developers, and the hands-on control required by those of the devops persuasion, such as myself. One of the main benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk is how quick and easy it is to spin up new environments, and I make heavy use of that in my work.

        I&rsquo;ve written about StatsD before, but it&rsquo;s time to pick up the pen again, at least in the proverbial sense (I&rsquo;m typing this on a laptop-chiclet keyboard). A few months ago I joined a new company: Takumi and we&rsquo;re building an iOS app married to a Python Flask-based backend. From many perspectives, a very similar tech stack as we used at QuizUp. And it&rsquo;s no coincidence. One of the founders of Takumi is Jökull Sólberg, who I worked closely with at QuizUp and as far as I know had a major effect on the initial technology stack used there.

        One of the services we use a lot for monitoring at QuizUp is Datadog. We use several software-as-a-service&rsquo;s, but this one is one of my absolute favorites. Datadog is an aggregator for StatsD metrics, and StatSD is as I have mentioned before, one of my favorite technologies. The way we use Datadog is both through their large set of excellent integrations, which retrieve a host of standard metrics from every third party service in our stack, but also monitor all of our hosts for standard operating system metrics like load average, disk usage, memory usage broken down by application, cpu load, etc; and we&rsquo;ve written our custom integrations if one did not exist before.

a question of not having found the right tool with a quick search, or
better: we prefer doing something differently and/or we enjoy the process

        Today we&rsquo;ve been busy migrating some AWS instances at work due to upcoming maintenance events in AWS. One of the instance families we used a lot when building QuizUp is the m2 instance family and almost all of our m2 instances will require restarts in the next few days. On some of these we are running large redis instances with tens of GB of data and restarting them is not pain-free, even if we would use the persistence features of redis, which work by periodically dumping the entire dataset into a dump.rdb file.
